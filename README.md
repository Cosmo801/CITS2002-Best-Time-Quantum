This project is used to simulate how an Opearting System will schedule running processes.

"Modern operating systems maintain a lot of state information to support their operation. Some of this information can be periodically captured to provide a snapshot of a currently running system, or logged for later analysis. For example, a tracefile can contain a summary of the execution history of completed processes, and the information may be used to improve the execution of future processes.

In combination, the execution requirements of processes and the input/output (I/O) operations they perform, is termed the job-mix. This project will use the information in a tracefile to find the near-optimal scheduling of processes, in the belief that future job-mixes will be similar to that in a recent tracefile." - CITS2002 Project 1 2019
